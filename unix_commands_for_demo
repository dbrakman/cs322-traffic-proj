# How to use the current file:
#   Step 1: Copy and paste current file into a file with the name 
#             unix_commands_for_nov2 
#           and save the resulting file in the iMac's Desktop directory
#   Step 2: Preserve that file using the Unix command:
#             cp -p unix_commands_for_nov2 save_unix_commands_for_nov2 
#   Step 3: Edit the file unix_commands_for_nov2 replacing File2, File3, etc.,
#           with your choice of class names; see NOTE1 below to understand
#           what this step means as File2, File 3, etc.
#   Step 4: Edit the file unix_commands_for_nov2 replacing "data1" with
#           your choice of "data2", etc., IF you wish to make such a change;
#           see NOTE2 below for what this step means as "data1", etc.
#   Step 5: Change the "mode" of the resulting file so the file becomes
#           executable under the Unix command interpreter, via the
#           following Unix command:
#             chmod +x unix_commands_for_nov2 
#   Step 6: Try an experiment using the resulting file:
#             ./unix_commands_for_nov2 
#           Scroll up and down the Unix window to see if that experiment
#           was as successful as you wanted it to be; if it is, 
#           go to Step 7.  (Otherwise go back to Step 3 or Step 4.)
#   Step 7: Do the following Unix to obtain a demo file:
#             script
#             cat unix_commands_for_nov2
#             ./unix_commands_for_nov2
#             exit
#             col -b < typescript > Demo_for_nov2_2016
#   Step 8: Submit all your *java files and all your *data* files and also
#           the file Demo_for_nov2_2016 to the folder for you team for
#           the top-level logic project due on Friday, where you submit
#           all those files during the lab on Wed, Nov 2, to show the
#           current state of your iterative enhancement.
